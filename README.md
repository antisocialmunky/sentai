# SENTAI
**noun**

1) In Japanese, sentai (戦隊?) is a military unit and may be literally translated as "squadron", "task force", "group" or "wing". The terms "regiment" and "flotilla", while sometimes used as translations of Sentai, are also used to refer to larger formations.

2) The **Super Sentai Series** (スーパー戦隊シリーズ Sūpā Sentai Shirīzu?) is a franchise of Japanese tokusatsu television dramas that uses the word sentai to describe a group of three or more costumed superheroes who often pilot fictional robotic vehicles.
